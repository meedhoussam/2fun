<p>  There are always ways to make good training even better and more effective. The following tips ensure optimal training results. Get the best out of your training.</p>



<p>  Nowadays, even bodybuilding beginners should know that variation is one of the most important factors for sustained progress in muscle building and strength gain. If you carry out the same training plan with the same variables (exercise sequence, number of sets, number of repetitions) over and over again without major changes, this ultimately leads to stagnation and a lack of further muscle building.</p>



<p>  This does not mean that you have to constantly change your training plan completely. If you integrate the following tips into the training, you will quickly find that you are making progress again.</p>



<h3>1. Do not follow a certain number of repetitions.</h3>



<p>  There are still many bodybuilders who do 3 sets of 10 reps by default on almost all exercises. They come to the studio, choose a weight for the bench press, for example, with which they can definitely do 10 repetitions. You do a set, then a pause, the next 10 repetitions, pause and a third time. After a few months, they are amazed that they are no longer making progress in terms of muscle building and strength gain.</p>



<p>  The problem with that; the body has enough time to get used to the strain. If you continue training with 10 repetitions and can easily do them in each of the 3 sets, you will ensure that the body and muscles can adjust to the load. Then there are no further signs of adaptation, the training stimulus for the muscles is not high enough for further muscle building. In theory, you can train for years without any noteworthy progress.</p>



<p>  Instead of aiming for the typical 10 repetitions after the warm-up set, you should instead choose higher weights that only allow repetitions between 6-8. Especially at the beginning of the training when the energy levels are still high. Sets with repetitions between 8-10 can then be performed later in the training.</p>



<p>  If you would like to continue training with 10 reps, you should definitely choose the weight so that you are just 10 reps. can create. If you are 10Wdh. can do without having to deflect the movement or need help, then you should definitely take more weight. This tip mainly applies to multi-joint exercises such as bench press, lat pulldown, squat, neck press and the training goal of building muscle and gaining strength.</p>



<h3>2. If possible, schedule your Monday training on a Sunday.</h3>



<p>  As you have probably already noticed, Monday is the worst day for training, especially if you are one of the many who want to train chest on Monday. So even if you prefer to watch the sports show on Sunday or plan other activities, Sunday is a great day for a workout.</p>



<p>  If all the benches for your breast training are occupied on a Monday, the studio on Sunday is usually super empty. Bodybuilders at a higher level therefore often train on Sundays in order to be able to carry out their training plan even without unwanted breaks.</p>



<h3>3. Install small cardio sessions in the breaks between sets.</h3>



<p>  As a rule, many athletes use the breaks between sets for a small small talk with training partners or a nice girl, share selfies on Facebook / Instagram or simply dream away. Cardio training is still waiting for most athletes, especially in the definition phase, at the end of regular strength training. W</p>



<p>  So is there any argument against integrating cardio training into the strength training unit so that your stay in the studio is shorter and the training becomes more effective?</p>



<p>  So instead of chatting with the girls, or squeezing your butt flat between sets on a bench, you can speed things up, train your cardiovascular system and burn calories, all at the same time. Active relaxation in the form of moderate cardio training between sets ensures more productive training and significantly shortens the time spent in the studio. During breaks you can use the stepper, jump rope or do box jumps for about a minute each.</p>



<p>  Those who incorporate rapid cardio training as active relaxation into their training 1-2 times a week increase their overall performance, since the balance, footwork, overall strength and muscle endurance improve significantly within just a few weeks.</p>



<h3>4. Use smaller weights on the barbell.</h3>



<p>  From a certain training level, it makes sense to train with a training partner. In order to achieve an optimal growth stimulus for the muscles, one has to train until the load is stopped. With many exercises, this is not possible without a training partner. But since the weight range in which you train is often quite different, it makes sense to find a convenient way to exchange weights between the training sets of both athletes.</p>



<h3>5. Use pulling aids for a few extra repetitions.</h3>



<p>  It is definitely wasted energy if you have to constantly change 20kg discs. If you use smaller weight plates such as 5, 10 or 15 kg plates, the training weights can be converted more easily, which saves time and energy. This variant is also positive for dropsets, as you can gradually remove the small slices from the barbell and thus make the dropsets finely graded.</p>



<p>  You have certainly experienced it more often; when back training on the lat machine or also with standard pull-ups, the grip fails earlier than the back muscles. However, it is counterproductive for optimal muscle development or for strength gain if the back cannot be properly trained due to the decreasing holding power of the hands.</p>



<p>  If you feel that your grip is weakening, use a few pulling aids and you will be able to do a few more repetitions per set, which in turn will help you build more muscle. Grip strength shouldn’t be the limiting factor on your back day. If you want to train the forearm muscles in order to strengthen the grip strength, you should include exercises for the forearm muscles at the end of the bicep training.</p>



<p>  If you use pulling aids, you should ensure that the latissimus can be trained in isolation and that the pulling aids take over the holding work. The advantage is that you don’t have to choose an excessively firm grip even with very heavy weights. The forearms are protected and the focus is on the back, which can be optimally trained. But that doesn’t mean that you should only train with pulling aids, even with the lighter sets. It makes sense to train part of the exercise without pulling aids so that the grip and forearm muscles are also trained.</p>



<h3>6. Mega Pump with the 10min. Arm training</h3>



<p>  You should try this system once, then you will definitely stick with it. Let’s say you train your chest and triceps in one day. You do your breast training quite normally, with lots of heavy pressure exercises. Instead of doing your normal tricep workout after the chest training – you have already challenged the triceps with the heavy chest exercises – you choose a single exercise such as triceps pressing on the rope and do the exercise for 10 minutes. continuous.</p>



<p>  Here is the exact process: You choose a weight with which you can do about 10-12 repetitions. Do your sentence, but then you take a break of only 20sec. (no longer between sentences). Fatigue will appear quickly as the triceps cannot fully recover during the short break. If you cannot do 8 repetitions in the next set, you can reduce the weight by one plate.</p>



<p>  The next set will then be a little easier and you may do 12 reps again. But if the break is at 20sec. remains, the weight will feel pretty heavy again quickly and you can reduce the weight again. Do you have the exercise after 10min. completed, this simple combination of workout / pause with drop sets triggered the best triceps pump you have ever had. You will feel the muscle acidity in the triceps for a few more days.</p>



<p>  You can do that for 10min. Use training in exactly the same way for bicep training, ideally after back training, for a killer pump in your arms.</p>



<h3>7. Shorten the training times in the studio</h3>



<p>  If you need 2 hours for your training, then you should work to increase the intensity by making each set heavier and harder. There are only a few athletes who can do a very intensive workout over 2 hours. You can do a longer workout with moderate intensity, but it doesn’t do much if you want to build muscle faster and more clearly. Powerlifters often do relatively long workouts, but that’s because they often do more warm-up sets and relatively long breaks between sets.</p>



<p>  So if your workouts last about 2 hours, then you should work to increase intensity (and less chatter between sets) by making each set heavier and harder. Do not add more and more exercises and sets to your training plan, it only lengthens the training session unnecessarily.</p>



<p>  You are a bodybuilder and not a powerlifter, so shorter breaks between sets and exercises have two main advantages for you. It has been shown that shorter breaks and a higher volume support the hormonal activities of the body. This means that muscle building also goes faster. It also makes it easier to stay focused throughout the training session. Mental fatigue usually leads to a poor focus and poor exercise performance, which can also result in injury.</p>



<p>  Successful bodybuilders only need about 60-75min for their training in the studio. But what they save in terms of duration is more than good in terms of intensity. Since there is something else besides the training, a daily time saving (at least on the training days) of up to an hour is not the worst. Especially when the muscle building is usually even better.</p>



<h3>8. Don’t do almost identical exercises multiple times.</h3>



<p>  During a workout, you should train the large muscle groups with exercises that strain them from different angles. During breast training you can vary the angle of the bench, for example, and the position of the hands, feet and body, so as not to duplicate similar movements. Flat bench, incline bench and inverse incline bench press train the pectoral muscle from different angles, but there are not so big differences between flat bench presses on the machine, barbell or dumbbell flat bench presses.</p>



<p>  Training from different angles, especially for the larger muscle groups, ensures that every muscle fiber is addressed during training, especially if the muscle being trained has different approaches. If you do an identical exercise with different equipment / dumbbells, you will improve muscle coordination, but changing from a machine to a barbell or a dumbbell with the same angle when performing the movement does not change much in the strain on the different muscle fibers.</p>



<p>  If you then want to do the same exercise with the same angle and different equipment, then you should at least vary the grip position or the position (e.g. in the case of squats). A variation in the grip position changes the weighting when using the primarily involved muscle and can increase the use of supporting muscle groups.</p>



<h3>9. Learn how to best protect your back.</h3>



<p>  In order to protect the lumbar region and to best address the muscles to be trained, you should learn which back posture is most advantageous. It is similar to riding a bicycle, the movement is not naturally in our blood, we have to consciously learn to ride a bicycle and correct the mistakes that occur.</p>



<p>  It is the same with correct posture and muscle tension in the lower back. But while a slight fall with the bike only causes a few bruises and abrasions, poor posture with a rounded back when exercising with heavy weights can damage the spine, which can also be irreparable. In the worst case, a herniated disc can occur if you do not protect the spine by correct posture during training.</p>



<p>  You can protect the spine and address the muscles better if you learn how the back should be curved best. This is particularly important for exercises with a bent posture, such as bent rowing, deadlifts, etc.</p>



<p>  With a normal or slightly modified curvature in the lower back area, one ensures stability in the middle of the body. If you then inhale during the negative movement, stretch out your chest and pull in your stomach, you also increase the tension in the abdominal muscles and thus ensure a significantly higher tension and strength in the middle of the body. As a small additional bonus, tensing the abdominal muscles also builds them up.</p>



<p>  The following posture exercise should be repeated regularly, especially for bodybuilding beginners, the correct learning of the technique is a little insurance to prevent injuries. To control posture, stand sideways to a mirror, then bend forward 45 degrees, stick your butt out, keep your chest wide and open, and bend your knees slightly. Then look sideways in the mirror and check the body position. You should now be able to see a slight curvature downwards (a light hollow back) in the lumbar region, no cat hump upwards.</p>



<h3>10. Finish training with forearm and lower back exercises.</h3>



<p>  If you are almost through with your training, you can very well train the weakest parts of the body until the end of stress. For most bodybuilders, that’s the grip and lower back. You can train a better grip with forearm training or a special grip training. After training, you should no longer be able to hold onto anything.</p>



<p>  Once you have completely exhausted your lower back from an exercise point of view, standing upright is extremely difficult. This is also the reason why hard training for the back extensor should be carried out at the end of the training. If the lower back is already tired, this increases the risk of injury during heavy strength exercises such as squats, deadlifts, etc. Exercises for the lower back can be trained very well on the back day.</p>



<p>  The same applies to the forearms and grip training. If you have trained hard, you will have difficulty holding anything. A heavy set of bent over rowing after forearm training? It won’t work … So you should take care of your forearms until you are done with your bicep workout and no other muscle groups should follow. If you are training a muscle group the next day, in which the forearms also play an important role, then you should not train them.</p>



<h3>11. Don’t be a wimp during training.</h3>



<p>  When it comes to lifting really heavy weights, many (would-be) bodybuilders find it difficult. But they all want to have a monster body. But if you approach the training too loosely and tend to avoid heavy exercises with free weights such as squats, deadlifts and bench presses, you will not have a great success with your training program.</p>



<p>  This also includes extreme deflection of movements to make the exercise easier. In bench presses, for example, this includes letting the barbell bounce on your chest so that you can push it up again more easily. Even if healthy falsification can sometimes make sense, if you overdo it, on the one hand minimizes the training effect, because the muscles are not optimally trained, on the other hand, the risk of injury increases, both counterproductive for success in bodybuilding.</p>



<p>  You should always look for a way to increase the difficulty of an exercise and make movements harder and not easier. For example, do additional repetitions, drop sets or shorten the pauses between sets: everything possible to make an exercise more difficult.</p>
